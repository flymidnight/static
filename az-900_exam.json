Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there are a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures.<br/>With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. By architecting your solutions to use replicated VMs in zones, you can protect your applications and data from the loss of a datacenter. If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly available in another zone.<br/>References:<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability<br/></br></br></p>"

For example, restoring a virtual machine from backup after a virtual machine failure.<br/>Box 3:<br/>Dynamic scalability is the ability for compute resources to be added to a service when the service is under heavy load.  For example, in a virtual machine scale set, additional instances of the virtual machine are added when the existing virtual machines are under heavy load.<br/>Box 4:<br/>Latency is the time a service to respond to requests.

This is very common.  When you need more resources, rather than pay out for new on-premises infrastructure, you can configure a cloud environment and connect your on-premises network to the cloud environment by using a VPN.<br/><br/>Box 3: No -<br/>It is not true that only guest users can access cloud resources.  You can give anyone with an account in Azure Active Directory access to the cloud resources.<br/>There are many authentication scenarios but a common one is to replicate your on-premises Active Directory accounts to Azure Active Directory and provide access to the Azure Active Directory accounts.  Another commonly used authentication method is ג€˜Federationג€™ where authentication for access to cloud resources is passed to another authentication provider such as an on-premises Active Directory.<br/>Reference:<br/>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/<br/></br></br></p>"

PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications.

Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools<br/>(such as Microsoft Office 365).<br/>SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organization, and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software, and app data are located in the service providerג€™s data center. The service provider manages the hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well. SaaS allows your organization to get quickly up and running with an app at minimal upfront cost.<br/>Reference:<br/>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-paas/<br/></br></br></p>"

You also specify the IP address prefixes that will be routed through the VPN gateway to the VPN device. The address prefixes you specify are the prefixes located on your on-premises network.

Azure status informs you of service outages in Azure on the Azure Status page.

The video playback experience would be improved if they can download the video from servers in the same region as the users.  We can achieve this by using a content deliver network.<br>A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.<br/>Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached, by leveraging various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).<br/>The benefits of using Azure CDN to deliver web site assets include:<br/>✑ Better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round-trips are required to load content.<br/>✑ Large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event.<br/>✑ Distribution of user requests and serving of content directly from edge servers so that less traffic is sent to the origin server.<br/>References:<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-overview<br/></br></br></p>"

It is a large-scale, distributed, MPP (massively parallel processing) relational database technology in the same class of competitors as Amazon Redshift or Snowflake. Azure SQL<br/>Synapse Analytics is an important component of the Modern Data Warehouse multi-platform architecture. Because Azure SQL Synapse Analytics is an MPP system with a shared-nothing architecture across distributions, it is meant for large-scale analytical workloads which can take advantage of parallelism.<br/>Box 2:<br/>Azure Machine Learning uses past trainings to provide predictions that have high probability.<br/>Machine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. By using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed.<br/>Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might want based on what you've bought.<br/>Box 3:<br/>Azure Functions provides serverless computing functionalities.<br/>Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.<br/>Box 4:<br/>IoT Hub (Internet of things Hub) provides data from millions of sensors.<br/>IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud- hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.<br/>Reference:<br/>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/synapse-analytics/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-ml https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview<br/></br></br></p>"

If either service fails, the whole application fails. The probability of each service failing is independent, so the composite SLA for this application is 99.95% ֳ— 99.99% = 99.94%. That's lower than the individual SLAs, which isn't surprising because an application that relies on multiple services has more potential failure points.<br/>Reference:<br/>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reliability/requirements#understand-service-level-agreements<br/></br></br></p>"
